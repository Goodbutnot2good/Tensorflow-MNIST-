    "In class you were briefly introduced to Keras, which is a high level machine learning library that can be used to create everything from an introductory model such as what you will be building to very complex models used in industry every day to handle everything from chat bots to object detection and more.\n",

    "In the last sprint you did some exploration that helped you understand the dataset and what was in it, this time you are going to prepare it for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Memon had talked about in his lecture taking your data and properly holding back some of it so that later you could use it to validate if your model was working or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "With K = 5 for the number of folds you will do the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have properly segmented your data you will have to train K-1 models and validate them. The code for the model has already been implemented, you do not need to worry about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is:\n",
    "    1. Split your dataset into K even sets of data using the k-fold algorithm.\n",
    "    2. Train a model on set K=0\n",
    "    3. Validate the model on set K=1\n",
    "    4. Repeat for K+1 and K+2\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note:** Training the models will take some time depending on your computer, each model will be saved so after you are sure this part is working you should only have to do it once. If you mess something up you can delete the model files and start again.\n",
